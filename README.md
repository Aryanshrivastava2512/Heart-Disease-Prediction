##  Project Overview

This project aims to predict whether a patient has heart disease or not using Machine Learning classification algorithms.

The model analyzes various medical attributes such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other clinical parameters to determine the presence of heart disease.

This project demonstrates:
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance comparison

- Cholesterol Level
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Resting ECG
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
- Exercise Induced Angina
- ST Depression
- Slope of Peak Exercise ST Segment
- Number of Major Vessels
- Thalassemia
- Target (0 = No Heart Disease, 1 = Heart Disease)
